# OS_Radar

Date 2017/01/19

Created by Jasper Janssens for OLYMPIA STADION
a video installation by David Claerbout

This is a Processing v3.2.3 script written in Java
using the controlP5 library for the user interface
It is used in conjunction with a browser & Screenhunter Pro 6.0

AT this time i configured firefox with extension 'Tab Reloader' that reloads this page every 5 minutes:
https://weather.com/weather/radar/interactive/l/GMXX8440:1:GM

Screenhunter then runs in the background making a screenshot of the PC screen every minute and 
saves this to the OS_RADAR script folder (eg. C:\OS_RADAR\)
